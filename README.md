# CourseDataAnalysis
This repository features a parser (Python script) that reads the course list JSON file and produces a JSON output with 
relevant information used for data analysis. The course list JSON file contains a list of courses, each of which has
individual course information such as class size, lecture times, subject, course name, etc

### Files
- `classDataParser.py`: This Python script parses the course list JSON file and produces a JSON output with relevant 
information used for data analysis.
- `sampleCourses.json`: Because the official myUCLA courses JSON should be remain private, I made this sample JSON file 
detailing possible JSON objects that were found in myUCLA courses and possible edge cases to ensure my parser is robust.
